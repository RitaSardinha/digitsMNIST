# Machine Learning Model using TensorFlow and Keras

This README provides an overview of the machine learning model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving impressive validation results.

## Model Overview
The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to perform image classification. It consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. Here is a breakdown of the key components:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
* The MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in dataset loader.
* The images are reshaped to have a 28x28x1 shape (1 channel for grayscale) and normalized by dividing by 255.0 to scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].

### Model Architecture
* The model starts with a convolutional layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel, followed by the ReLU activation function.
* Batch normalization is applied after the first convolutional layer to improve training stability.
* Another convolutional layer with 64 filters and a 3x3 kernel is added, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
* Max-pooling with a 2x2 pool size is applied to reduce spatial dimensions.
* Dropout with a rate of 25% is used to prevent overfitting.
* The feature maps are flattened into a vector.
* A fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation is added.
* Batch normalization is applied again.
* Dropout with a rate of 50% is used to further prevent overfitting.
* The final output layer consists of 10 neurons with a softmax activation function, providing class probabilities for each digit (0-9).

### Model Compilation
* The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
* Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.
  
### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is performed using the TensorFlow ImageDataGenerator to create variations of the training data, including rotations, zooming, and shifting. This technique helps improve the model's generalization.

### Training
The model is trained for 15 epochs using the augmented training data. The fit method is used with batch sizes of 32.

### Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset (x_test, y_test) to calculate the validation loss and accuracy. The achieved validation results are impressive:

* Validation Loss: 0.0204
* Validation Accuracy: 0.9940

### Usage
To use this model, you can follow these steps:
* Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed in your Python environment.
* Copy and paste the provided code into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the script to load the data, define the model, compile it, perform data augmentation, train the model, and evaluate its performance - This is better if you are using GPU.
* You can also customize hyperparameters, model architecture, and training parameters to experiment with different configurations and achieve even better results.
